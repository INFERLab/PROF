# Overview

PROjected Feasibility (PROF) is a method to enforce convex operational constraints within neural policies, by incorporating a differentiable projection layer within a neural network-based policy to enforce that all learned actions are feasible. We then update the policy end-to-end by propagating gradients through this differentiable projection layer, making the policy cognizant of the operational constraints. The result is a powerful neural policy that can flexibly optimize performance on the true underlying dynamics, while still satisfying the specified constraints.

We demonstrate our method on two applications: energy-efficient building operation and inverter control. 
- In the building control case, PROF outperforms other RL agents, while maintaining temperature within the deadband except when the control is saturated.
- In the inverter control setting, PROF satisfies the constraints 100% of the time and minimizes curtailment as well as possible within its conservative safe set after learning safely for half a day.
